    <h4>A Day in My Life</h4>
        <t>With each new chapter of life, my day looks different.<br><br> 

            Currently, my days have been going something like this:<br><br>
            
            I set my alarm for 4:30-5 to give myself adequate time to ease into the day. I prefer to avoid the pressure of feeling rushed as much as possible. If I’m really tired I give myself the option to sleep in until 6. When I get up, I try to do at least one thing I know is good for me, such as journaling, meditating, yoga, or eating a healthy breakfast. The more I can do, the better.<br><br> 
            
            I make sure I’m ready to leave the house by 7 sharp, as I have an hour-long drive ahead of me to get to my classes and want to be on time. I enjoy the sunrise on my way there, especially against the skyline of Kansas City. I love to listen to music and sing, or pull up a YouTube video so I can passively learn about the technical skills we’re being taught at i.c.stars.<br><br> 
            
            When I pull into the parking garage, I drive to the top floor so I can use the skywalk and stay out of the cold as much as possible. It also feels safer than being inside the parking garage and walking alone on the street, especially at night. I enjoy seeing all the colorful lights from the surrounding buildings, and being under the night sky, when I come back out to my car.<br><br>
            
            When I get to the Learning Studio, I pick a spot facing the window and set my things down. Lately, I’ve liked sitting close to the instructors. After I’ve done that, I make myself a cup of coffee or tea. It’s a nice treat that helps me transition into a focused mindset. Then I chat with my cohorts or find a quiet place to work on my own. <br><br>
            
            Then, the day starts! It simultaneously feels like the longest and shortest day ever. Every day. Without fail. It’s packed with stimuli that I could spend hours processing, but there is limited time so I do what I can. When I drive home at night, it’s often in silence. Sometimes I will speak out loud to myself, as it keeps everything from continually spinning around in my head.<br><br> 
            
            When I get to where I’m staying, I try to sit down at my laptop for an hour or two. When my brain and body can’t do anymore, I collapse into bed!
            
            Everyday is different, but this is the consistency I strive for.

    <h4>Challenges I've Overcome</h4>
        <ol>In 6th grade, students were tested to see which ones would be placed in advanced classes the next year. I took pride in being a good student, and really wanted to be placed in the advanced math class. Initially, my score was too low, so I went home everyday after school and got on Khan Academy until I felt confident I knew the matieral. When I took the test again, it paid off! I got into the class I wanted! It was extra exciting because my math teacher that year, Mr. Tacke (very fitting name by the way), singled me out in class one day and made me cry. It was a double victory, as I did what I set out to do, and I didn't need his help.
        </ol><br>
        <ol>Roughly January 2021, my old roommate and I were coming back down the mountain to go home from work. The icy roads along I-70 caused hazardous conditions, and there was a car whose wheels were spinning and spinning. Their plates read "Florida," and there was a long line of traffic acruing. My roommate and I got out and told them to use their floor mats to help get a grip on the snow. It worked, and everyone got to go home safely. 
        </ol><br>
        <ol>When I was a catering supervisor at CPKC Stadium I thought of an idea that solved a lot of issues we were having with fresh food and timely deliveries. The stadium layout is entirely counterintuitive when it comes to the kitchens. There are two, and the main one is on the wrong side. I cut down running time by stocking hotboxes ahead of time and finding safe, acceptable, convenient places to stash them.
        </ol><br>
        <ol>When I was bartering my rent, there was a baby draft horse on the property named Nashira. It was my job to bring her into her stall in the morning, feed her, and bring her back out. However, sometimes she didn't want to go back out into the field. It would be common for a lot of horse handlers to simply apply more pressure or force in order to get a horse to do something they wanted, but my mentor discouraged teaching power-struggles to the horses. Instead of yanking her reins or slapping her on the butt, I would simply swing the rope towards her rear to get her to walk in a circle. Usually, this would be enough to "reset" her and get her to walk alongside me out to pasture. If that didn't work, I would pair what it seemed like she wanted to do with what I needed to get done. She often was more inclined to walk backwards, so sometimes I would just have her take ackwards steps until she was out to pasture again.</ol>
    <h4>A Dream Project or Job</h4>
        <t>I dreamed of becoming an artist as a child. I think it would be really cool to be one of the artists responsible for a mural in Kansas City. It would be an honor to have my art in placces like CPKC Stadium, ArtSpace at KCAI, Loews hotel, or even the airport.

    <h4>Inspirational Figures</h4>
        <ol>Terri Meredith, my aunt</ol>
        <ol>Mary Tyler Moore</ol>
        <ol>Fumi, a.k.a. "Maha Maven"</ol>
    <h4>What I Want Most Out of I C Stars</h4>
        <t>I want a balance of freedom and stability, so I can makes my dreams come true, dream bigger afterwards, and give back with greater impact.</t>
